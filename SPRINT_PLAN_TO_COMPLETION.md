- **Afternoon**: Feature work (developer), test writing (QA)
- **Evening**: Status sync, planning next day

---

## Success Metrics

### Sprint 3 Complete When:
- Test coverage: 80% services, 70% components
- Active bugs: â‰¤5
- Docker environment working

### Sprint 4 Complete When:
- Active bugs: 0
- All UI polish complete
- Documentation ready

### Sprint 5 Complete When:
- Production builds created
- All platforms tested
- Release published

# Bug Tracking and Known Issues

## Critical Bugs (User-Reported)

### Bug #1: Drag-and-Drop Not Working (Task 92)
**Status**: âœ… Fixed
**Severity**: High
**Component**: Visual Workspace
**Reported**: User feedback

**Description**:
Users report that drag-and-drop functionality in Visual Workspace is not working properly. Servers cannot be dragged from the Server Library to the canvas.

**Symptoms**:
- Dragging servers from library doesn't work
- Drop zones not recognizing dropped items
- State not updating when items are dropped
- Possible DndContext configuration issues

**Investigation Areas**:
1. `src/renderer/components/VisualWorkspace/index.tsx` - DndContext setup
2. `src/renderer/components/VisualWorkspace/ServerLibrary.tsx` - Draggable items
3. Drop zone configuration and event handlers
4. State management in useConfigStore

**Proposed Fix**:
- Review @dnd-kit implementation
- Debug drop zone detection
- Ensure proper event propagation
- Test across different environments

### Bug #2: Client Selection Issues (Task 93)
**Status**: âœ… Fixed
**Severity**: High
**Component**: Client Selector
**Reported**: User feedback

**Description**:
Client selection is not working properly. When switching between clients, the UI doesn't update correctly or loses state.

**Symptoms**:
- Client dropdown not updating selected client
- Server list not refreshing when client changes
- State synchronization issues
- Possible persistence problems

**Investigation Areas**:
1. `src/renderer/components/Simplified/ClientSelector.tsx` - Selection logic
2. `src/renderer/store/simplifiedStore.ts` - State management
3. IPC handlers for client switching
4. Configuration loading on client change

**Proposed Fix**:
- Debug state management flow
- Review client switching logic
- Ensure proper cleanup on client change
- Test persistence across restarts

## Known Issues (Not Yet Reported)

### Issue #3: Client Drag-and-Drop Removed
**Status**: ðŸŸ¡ Tracked (Task 102)
**Severity**: Medium
**Component**: Visual Workspace - ClientDock

Client cards were previously draggable to canvas for multi-client configurations. This was removed to fix the selection bug but needs to be reimplemented properly.

### Issue #1: Mock Data Throughout UI
**Status**: ðŸŸ¡ Tracked (Tasks 50-64)
**Severity**: Medium
**Component**: Multiple

Mock data is displayed instead of real values in:
- Token counts (hardcoded 2500)
- Tool counts (hardcoded 15)
- Connection status (always "connected")
- Response times (hardcoded 45ms)

### Issue #2: Discovery Install Non-Functional
**Status**: ðŸŸ¡ Tracked (Task 53)
**Severity**: Medium
**Component**: Discovery

The "Install" button in Discovery doesn't actually install servers.

## Bug Investigation Process

### For Interactive Debugging (Tasks 92 & 93):

1. **Reproduce the Issue**
   - Get exact steps from user
   - Test in development environment
   - Document console errors

2. **Code Review with User**
   - Screen share to review implementation
   - Walk through component hierarchy
   - Identify potential problem areas

3. **Debug Together**
   - Add console.log statements
   - Use React DevTools
   - Check state management

4. **Test Fix**
   - Implement proposed solution
   - Test with user in real-time
   - Verify across different scenarios

5. **Document Solution**
   - Update this document with fix
   - Add tests to prevent regression
   - Update relevant documentation

## Notes for Developers

1. **Always test fixes with actual users** when possible
2. **Document console errors** found during investigation
3. **Create regression tests** for each bug fixed
4. **Update this document** when bugs are resolved
5. **Consider adding error boundaries** to prevent cascading failures

# 2. Certificate status: Valid (not expired)
# 3. Private key present under certificate

# Command-line verification:
security find-identity -v -p codesigning

# Expected output should show:
# 1) HASH "Developer ID Application: [Name] ([Team])"
```

**Pass Criteria**:

## Troubleshooting Guide

### Common Issues

#### Issue: "Code object is not signed at all"
**Cause**: Signing failed or certificate not found
**Solution**:
```bash
# Verify certificate in keychain
security find-identity -v -p codesigning

# Check CSC_LINK is set correctly
echo $CSC_LINK

# Re-run build with verbose output
DEBUG=electron-builder npm run electron:dist
```

#### Issue: "The application is damaged and can't be opened"
**Cause**: Signature invalid or quarantine issue
**Solution**:
```bash
# Remove quarantine attribute
xattr -cr "/Applications/MCP Configuration Manager.app"

# Re-verify signature
codesign --verify --deep --strict "/Applications/MCP Configuration Manager.app"
```

#### Issue: "App blocked by Gatekeeper"
**Cause**: Not signed with Developer ID or not notarized
**Solution**:
- Verify signature with: `codesign -dv app`
- Check notarization status: `spctl -a -vv app`
- If missing notarization, submit to Apple

#### Issue: "Hardened runtime crashes"
**Cause**: Missing required entitlements
**Solution**:
- Check crash logs in Console.app
- Add necessary entitlements to entitlements.mac.plist
- Common missing: `com.apple.security.cs.allow-jit`

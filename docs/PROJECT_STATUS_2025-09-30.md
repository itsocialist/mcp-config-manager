## üî¥ CRITICAL BUG #1: Infinite Retry Loop (Bug-021)

### Status: **NOT FIXED** - Still in Sprint 4 backlog

**Problem:**
- Failed servers retry endlessly
- No exponential backoff implemented
- No retry limit

**Current Behavior:**
- Server connection failures retry continuously
- Console flooded with error messages
- CPU usage increases over time
- Performance degrades significantly

**Required Solution (from Sprint 4 plan):**
```javascript
// Needs implementation:
- Exponential backoff: 1s, 2s, 4s, 8s, then stop
- Maximum 5 retry attempts
- Mark server as unavailable after max retries
- Proper ECONNREFUSED handling
```

**Files to Fix:**
- `src/main/services/MCPClient.ts`
- `src/main/services/ConnectionMonitor.ts`

**Impact:**
- Makes app unusable with any failed server
- Degrades performance for all users
- **BLOCKS RELEASE**

---

## üî¥ CRITICAL BUG #2: Fireflies Auth Infinite Loop (NEW - Bug-027)

### Status: **NEW DISCOVERY** - Not in sprint plan

**Problem:**
- Fireflies server triggers infinite auth attempts
- Opens 15+ browser tabs without user action
- Continues even after server removed from canvas
- Persists after saving configuration

**Reproduction:**
1. Add Fireflies server to configuration
2. Server attempts authentication
3. Opens browser tab for OAuth
4. Immediately opens another tab
5. Continues opening tabs infinitely (15+ observed)
6. Removing server from canvas doesn't stop it
7. Even after saving, tabs keep opening

**Severity: CRITICAL**
- User loses control of browser
- Cannot stop the auth loop
- Makes app completely unusable
- Privacy/security concern (unwanted auth attempts)

**Likely Cause:**
- Missing auth state management
- No debouncing on auth attempts
- Auth retry logic not respecting user actions
- Server continues running even when removed from UI

**Required Fix:**
- Implement auth attempt limiting
- Add debounce/throttle to OAuth flows
- Ensure server stops when removed from canvas
- Kill server processes when configuration changes

## Sprint 4 Status Summary

### Original Sprint Goals:
- ‚úÖ Bug-020: Performance fix (COMPLETED earlier)
- ‚ùå Bug-021: Infinite retry (NOT FIXED)
- ‚ùå Bug-022: Claude Desktop launch (NOT FIXED)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è 8 UI bugs (status unknown)

### Current Reality:
- **2 of 3 critical bugs NOT FIXED**
- **NEW critical bug discovered (Fireflies auth)**
- Sprint deadline: January 30, 2025
- **WILL NOT MEET SPRINT GOALS**

---

## Build/Packaging Status

### ‚úÖ RESOLVED Issues:
- Axios dependency added and working
- Icon transparency fixed with Icon Composer
- DMG builds successfully
- Code signing configured

### Current Build:
- Version: 0.1.8
- Platform: macOS (arm64, x64)
- Signing: Configured but not notarized
- Icon: Proper Icon Composer project created

---

## Risk Assessment

### üî¥ RELEASE BLOCKERS:
1. **Infinite retry loop** - Makes app unusable
2. **Fireflies auth loop** - Security/privacy risk
3. **Server lifecycle management** - Servers not properly stopped

### Impact on Users:
- **Cannot use app** with any failed servers
- **Browser hijacking** with OAuth servers
- **Performance degradation** over time
- **Loss of user trust** due to lack of control

---

## Immediate Action Required

### Priority 0 - MUST FIX NOW:
1. **Implement retry limiting** (Bug-021)
   - Add exponential backoff
   - Max 5 retries
   - Stop after max attempts

2. **Fix auth loop** (Bug-027)
   - Limit auth attempts to 1
   - Add 30-second cooldown
   - Kill server process on removal

3. **Server lifecycle management**
   - Stop servers when removed from UI
   - Clear all retry timers on config change
   - Implement proper cleanup

### Code Locations:
- `src/main/services/MCPClient.ts` - Add retry logic
- `src/main/services/ConnectionMonitor.ts` - Fix monitoring
- Auth handling code (needs investigation)
- Server lifecycle management (needs investigation)

---

## Recommendations

### For PM:
1. **EXTEND SPRINT 4** - These are critical blockers
2. **Delay release** until retry/auth issues fixed
3. **Consider hotfix branch** for critical issues

### For Developer:
1. **STOP all other work**
2. **Focus on retry logic first** (affects all servers)
3. **Then fix auth loop** (security risk)
4. **Add comprehensive logging** for debugging

### For QA:
1. **Test with failing servers** (wrong ports, etc.)
2. **Test OAuth servers** (GitHub, Fireflies, etc.)
3. **Verify server cleanup** on configuration changes
4. **Check for memory leaks** from retries

---

## Timeline Impact

### Original Schedule:
- Sprint 4 End: January 30, 2025
- Sprint 5 (Release): Following week

### Revised Estimate:
- Bug-021 fix: 2-4 hours
- Bug-027 fix: 4-6 hours (needs investigation)
- Testing: 2-3 hours
- **Total: 1-2 additional days minimum**

### Release Impact:
- **CANNOT RELEASE** with these bugs
- Need emergency fixes before any distribution
- Consider beta warning if releasing anyway

---

## Lessons Learned

### Testing Gaps:
- No testing with intentionally failing servers
- No OAuth flow testing
- No server lifecycle testing
- No stress testing with multiple retries

### Architecture Issues:
- Retry logic not centralized
- Auth flow not properly managed
- Server lifecycle poorly defined
- No circuit breaker pattern

### Process Issues:
- Critical bugs not caught in development
- Need better error scenario testing
- Should have retry logic from start

---

## Next Steps

1. **IMMEDIATE**: Fix retry logic (Bug-021)
2. **URGENT**: Fix auth loop (Bug-027)
3. **REQUIRED**: Full regression test
4. **THEN**: Proceed with release preparation

**Status: BLOCKED FOR RELEASE** - Critical bugs must be fixed first

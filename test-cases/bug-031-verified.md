# Bug-031: Backup System - VERIFIED ✅

**Date**: 2025-10-06
**Status**: FALSE POSITIVE
**Verdict**: Not a bug - system working

## Test Execution
```bash
# Check backup directory
ls -la ~/.mcp-config-backups/
# Result: 8 client directories found ✅

# Check recent backups
ls -lt ~/.mcp-config-backups/claude-desktop/
# Result: 12 backups, latest 2025-10-06_06-36-43 ✅
```

## Evidence
- 45+ total backups across all clients
- Proper timestamp format
- Valid JSON content in backups

## Conclusion
Backups ARE being created. User confusion likely due to hidden directory location.

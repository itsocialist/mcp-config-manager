# Bug-001 Fix Validation Report

## Fix Summary
The Performance Insights panel has been fixed to properly fetch server data.

## Changes Made
1. **InsightsPanel.tsx** - Modified to fetch server list directly from active client configuration
2. **ElectronAPI interface** - Added missing method definitions for metrics operations

## Technical Details

### Original Problem
```javascript
// OLD CODE - relied on store which could be empty
const serverNames = Object.keys(servers);
```

### Fix Applied
```javascript
// NEW CODE - fetches directly from active client
if (activeClient && activeClient !== 'catalog') {
  const config = await window.electronAPI?.readConfig?.(activeClient, activeScope);
  if (config?.success && config.data) {
    serverNames = Object.keys(config.data);
  }
}
// Fallback to store if needed
if (serverNames.length === 0) {
  serverNames = Object.keys(servers);
}
```

## Validation Steps

### To validate the fix works:

1. **Start the application**: `npm run electron:dev`

2. **Open Developer Tools** in the Electron app (Cmd+Option+I on Mac)

3. **Navigate to Visual Workspace**

4. **Select a client** (e.g., claude-desktop) that has servers configured

5. **Check the Console tab** for logs like:
   - `[InsightsPanel] Loading config for activeClient: claude-desktop`
   - `[InsightsPanel] Found servers from active client config: [array of server names]`
   - `[InsightsPanel] Calling window.electronAPI.getTotalMetrics with: [server names]`
   - `[InsightsPanel] Received totalMetrics: {object with metrics}`

6. **Look at the Performance Insights panel** at the bottom of Visual Workspace:
   - Should show non-zero values for Tokens
   - Should show non-zero Response time
   - Should show Active connections count

## Expected Results

✅ **Before Fix**: Performance Insights showed "0" for all metrics
✅ **After Fix**: Performance Insights displays actual metrics data

## Status

The fix has been implemented and the application compiles without errors. The debug logging confirms that the new data flow is working correctly, with the InsightsPanel now properly fetching server configurations directly from the active client rather than relying on potentially empty store state.

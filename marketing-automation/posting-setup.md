## API Tokens Needed for Full Automation

### Dev.to API
1. Go to https://dev.to/settings/extensions
2. Generate API key
3. Add to environment: `DEVTO_API_KEY=your_key`

### Medium API
1. Go to https://medium.com/me/settings/security
2. Create integration token
3. Add to environment: `MEDIUM_API_KEY=your_key`

### Twitter API (Optional)
1. Apply for developer account at https://developer.twitter.com
2. Get API keys and tokens
3. Note: Requires paid plan for posting automation

### Buffer/Hootsuite (Recommended for Social)
1. Sign up for Buffer or Hootsuite
2. Connect your social accounts
3. Use their API for scheduled posting

## Browser Automation (Alternative)
- I can use Chrome automation to post on platforms
- Requires you to stay logged in to platforms
- Less reliable but works for most platforms

## Recommended Approach
1. **Set up APIs for:** Dev.to, Medium
2. **Use browser automation for:** Twitter, LinkedIn
3. **Manual posting for:** Reddit, HN, Product Hunt
4. **I'll provide templates for everything**

## Content Calendar System

# Test Results for Bug-021 and Bug-027 Fixes

## Test Date: 2025-01-30

### Bug-021: Infinite Retry Loop
**Status: ✅ VERIFIED**

#### Implementation Review:
- **Location**: `src/main/services/MCPClient.ts`
- **Max Retries**: 5 attempts
- **Exponential Backoff**: [1s, 2s, 4s, 8s, 16s]
- **Server Marking**: Marked as 'unavailable' after max attempts

#### Test Results:
- ✅ Retry logic properly implemented
- ✅ `MAX_RETRIES = 5` with exponential backoff working
- ✅ Server marked as 'unavailable' after max attempts
- ✅ No infinite loops detected
- ✅ ECONNREFUSED errors handled properly

### Bug-027: OAuth Authentication Loop
**Status: ✅ IMPLEMENTED & TESTED**

#### Implementation:
- **Location**: `src/main/services/MCPClient.ts` (lines 310-374)
- **Detection**: OAuth/auth URL patterns in stderr
- **Rate Limiting**: Max 1 auth attempt with 30s cooldown
- **Process Control**: Server killed after max attempts
- **Force Kill**: `forceKill()` method for immediate termination

#### Test Script Results:
```
OAuth URLs detected: 8 (in 5 seconds)
✅ OAuth URL detection is working
```

#### Features Verified:
- ✅ OAuth URL detection in stderr output
- ✅ Pattern matching for auth URLs working
- ✅ Rate limiting logic implemented
- ✅ Server termination on auth loop detection
- ✅ Force kill method for server cleanup

### Process Management
#### Before Fix:
- Multiple zombie processes observed
- Servers continuing to run after removal
- OAuth servers opening multiple browser tabs

#### After Fix:
- ✅ `forceKill()` method terminates servers immediately
- ✅ `ConnectionMonitor` uses force kill on server removal
- ✅ Auth loop detection prevents browser hijacking

### Code Quality:
- ✅ TypeScript compilation successful
- ✅ No type errors in implementation
- ✅ Test coverage for OAuth detection

## Conclusion

Both critical bugs have been successfully fixed:

1. **Bug-021** - Already implemented and working correctly
2. **Bug-027** - New comprehensive fix prevents OAuth loops

The fixes prevent:
- Performance degradation from infinite retries
- Browser hijacking from OAuth loops
- Orphaned server processes
- Resource exhaustion

## Next Steps

1. Monitor production for any edge cases
2. Consider adding telemetry for auth loop detection
3. Document OAuth server configuration best practices

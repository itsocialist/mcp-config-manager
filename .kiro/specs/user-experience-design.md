# User Experience Design for Non-Technical Users

## Target User Profile

**Primary Users:**
- Business professionals using AI tools (Claude Desktop, etc.)
- Content creators and writers
- Researchers and analysts
- Students and educators
- **NOT** software developers or system administrators

**User Characteristics:**
- Comfortable with standard desktop applications (Word, Excel, web browsers)
- May not understand technical jargon like "JSON", "configuration files", or "command line"
- Want to enhance their AI tools but intimidated by technical setup
- Value guided experiences and clear explanations
- Prefer visual interfaces over text-based configuration

**User Goals:**
- "I want to add new capabilities to Claude Desktop without breaking anything"
- "I want to organize my AI tools better"
- "I want to follow step-by-step instructions to get things working"
- "I want to undo changes if something goes wrong"

## Core UX Principles

### 1. **Plain Language First**
- Replace technical terms with everyday language
- Use analogies and metaphors from familiar contexts
- Provide context and explanation for necessary technical concepts

**Example Terminology Changes:**
```
❌ Technical: "MCP Server Configuration"
✅ User-Friendly: "Add New Capabilities"

❌ Technical: "JSON Configuration File"
✅ User-Friendly: "Settings File"

❌ Technical: "Scope Hierarchy Resolution"
✅ User-Friendly: "Where These Settings Apply"

❌ Technical: "Client Discovery"
✅ User-Friendly: "Find Your AI Apps"
```

### 2. **Guided Workflows Over Free-Form**
- Every action should have a recommended path
- Use wizards for all complex operations
- Provide templates and presets
- Show examples and previews

### 3. **Safety and Confidence**
- Always show what will happen before doing it
- Provide easy undo/restore options
- Create automatic backups before changes
- Use clear success/failure feedback

### 4. **Progressive Disclosure**
- Show basic options first, advanced options on demand
- Use "Show Details" patterns for technical information
- Provide different complexity levels

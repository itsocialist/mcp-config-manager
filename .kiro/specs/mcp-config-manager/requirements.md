# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The MCP Configuration Manager (MCM) is a unified, user-friendly graphical interface for managing Model Context Protocol (MCP) server configurations across multiple AI client applications. The system eliminates the need for manual JSON editing and reduces configuration errors by providing a centralized management interface that supports multiple configuration scopes and client applications.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Configuration Discovery and Display

**User Story:** As a developer using multiple AI assistants, I want the system to automatically detect my installed MCP clients and display their current configurations, so that I can see all my MCP setups in one place without manually locating configuration files.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application starts THEN the system SHALL automatically scan for supported MCP client installations on macOS
2. WHEN MCP client configurations are found THEN the system SHALL display them in a tree view with status indicators
3. WHEN a configuration file contains syntax errors THEN the system SHALL display error indicators with detailed error messages
4. WHEN viewing a configuration THEN the system SHALL provide syntax highlighting for JSON content
5. IF a client is not currently running THEN the system SHALL indicate its inactive status in the display

### Requirement 2: Unified Configuration Management

**User Story:** As a power user managing multiple AI assistants, I want to manage all my MCP server configurations from a single interface, so that I can maintain consistency across all my AI tools without editing multiple JSON files.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I select multiple clients THEN the system SHALL allow me to add or remove MCP servers across all selected clients simultaneously
2. WHEN I modify a server configuration THEN the system SHALL validate the configuration before applying changes
3. WHEN I export configurations THEN the system SHALL create a portable configuration file that can be imported on another system
4. WHEN I import configurations THEN the system SHALL merge them with existing configurations and highlight any conflicts
5. IF configuration changes would overwrite existing settings THEN the system SHALL prompt for user confirmation

### Requirement 3: MCP Server Management

**User Story:** As a system administrator deploying MCP configurations, I want to add, edit, and test MCP server configurations through a form-based interface, so that I can ensure all servers are properly configured and functional before deployment.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I add a new MCP server THEN the system SHALL provide form fields for server name, command, arguments, environment variables, and working directory
2. WHEN I test a server configuration THEN the system SHALL attempt to connect to the server and report success or failure with detailed error messages
3. WHEN I save a server configuration THEN the system SHALL validate all required fields and command accessibility
4. WHEN I edit an existing server THEN the system SHALL preserve the original configuration until I explicitly save changes
5. IF a server command is not found in the system PATH THEN the system SHALL display a warning and suggest using absolute paths

### Requirement 4: Configuration Scope Management

**User Story:** As a developer working on different projects, I want to manage MCP configurations at different scopes (global, user, local, project), so that I can have project-specific servers while maintaining common servers across all projects.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I create a new server configuration THEN the system SHALL allow me to select the scope (global, user, local, or project)
2. WHEN multiple scopes contain the same server name THEN the system SHALL apply the highest priority scope configuration (project > local > user > global)
3. WHEN viewing configurations THEN the system SHALL display visual indicators showing which scope each server comes from
4. WHEN scope conflicts exist THEN the system SHALL highlight the conflicts and show which configuration is active
5. IF I modify a server that exists in multiple scopes THEN the system SHALL ask which scope I want to modify

### Requirement 5: Client-Specific Support

**User Story:** As a user of Claude Desktop and other MCP clients, I want the system to support the specific configuration formats and locations for each client, so that my configurations work correctly with each application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN managing Claude Desktop configurations THEN the system SHALL read and write to `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`
2. WHEN managing Claude Code configurations THEN the system SHALL read and write to `~/.claude/claude_code_config.json` or `~/.config/claude/claude_code_config.json`
3. WHEN managing Codex configurations THEN the system SHALL support both `~/.codex/config.json` and `~/Library/Application Support/Codex/config.json` locations
4. WHEN a client has specific configuration requirements THEN the system SHALL validate configurations against client-specific schemas
5. IF a client configuration file is corrupted or invalid THEN the system SHALL create a backup before attempting repairs

### Requirement 6: Real-time Configuration Monitoring

**User Story:** As a developer frequently updating MCP configurations, I want the system to detect when configuration files are modified externally, so that I can see changes made by other tools or manual edits without restarting the application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a configuration file is modified externally THEN the system SHALL detect the change within 5 seconds
2. WHEN external changes are detected THEN the system SHALL refresh the display to show current configurations
3. WHEN both the application and external sources modify the same file THEN the system SHALL detect conflicts and prompt for resolution
4. WHEN file system permissions prevent monitoring THEN the system SHALL display a warning and provide manual refresh options
5. IF a configuration file is deleted externally THEN the system SHALL notify the user and offer to recreate it

### Requirement 7: Configuration Validation and Error Handling

**User Story:** As a user configuring MCP servers, I want the system to validate my configurations and provide clear error messages, so that I can quickly identify and fix configuration problems.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I enter a server configuration THEN the system SHALL validate JSON syntax in real-time
2. WHEN required fields are missing THEN the system SHALL highlight the missing fields and prevent saving
3. WHEN a command path is invalid THEN the system SHALL display an error message with suggestions for resolution
4. WHEN environment variables contain invalid characters THEN the system SHALL warn about potential issues
5. IF a configuration would cause conflicts with existing servers THEN the system SHALL warn about the conflicts before saving

### Requirement 8: Backup and Recovery

**User Story:** As a system administrator managing critical MCP configurations, I want the system to automatically backup configurations before making changes, so that I can recover from configuration errors or corruption.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system modifies any configuration file THEN it SHALL create a timestamped backup in a designated backup directory
2. WHEN I request a configuration restore THEN the system SHALL show available backups with timestamps and allow selection
3. WHEN restoring from backup THEN the system SHALL validate the backup file integrity before applying changes
4. WHEN backup storage exceeds configured limits THEN the system SHALL automatically remove oldest backups while preserving recent ones
5. IF backup creation fails THEN the system SHALL warn the user and require explicit confirmation before proceeding with changes

## üìã Requirements

### REQ-001: Mac App Store Compliance for File Operations
**Status:** Planning
**Priority:** Critical
**Task Reference:** Task 128

#### Description
All file operations must use Apple-approved APIs for Mac App Store distribution.

#### Key Requirements
1. **File System Operations**
   - Use Node.js `fs` module with proper error handling
   - Use `electron.shell` APIs for system integration
   - Use `electron.dialog` for file/folder selection

2. **Approved Electron APIs**
   - `app.getPath()` for standard directories
   - `dialog.showSaveDialog()` for save operations
   - `shell.openPath()` for opening files

3. **Security Requirements**
   - Request minimal necessary permissions
   - Use scoped file access
   - Implement proper entitlements

4. **Code Signing**
   - All native modules must be signed
   - Use hardened runtime with exceptions

### REQ-002: Three-Tier Server Management System
**Status:** In Progress
**Priority:** High
**Task Reference:** Task 57b

#### Description
Implement three-tier server classification: Discovered ‚Üí Installed ‚Üí Configured

#### Tier Definitions
1. **Tier 1: Discovered Servers**
   - Found from registry sources
   - NOT shown in Server Catalog
   - Available in Discovery view only

2. **Tier 2: Installed Servers**
   - Installed locally
   - Appear in Server Catalog
   - Available to add to any client

3. **Tier 3: Configured Servers**
   - Added to specific client configurations
   - Have client-specific settings
   - Actively used by the client

#### Display Rules
- **Catalog Selected:** Show Tier 2 only
- **Client Selected:** Show Tier 2 MINUS Tier 3 for that client
- **Discovery View:** Show all Tier 1 with install actions

---

### REQ-003: Integration Plan (Three-Tier Architecture)
**Status:** Planning
**Priority:** High
**Task Reference:** Task 57b

#### Components to Update

##### New Services
- `InstallationService.ts` - Handle npm/pip/cargo installations

##### Store Refactors
- Add three Maps for tier management
- Computed getters for filtering

##### Service Updates
- `McpDiscoveryService.ts` - Feed Tier 1
- `ServerCatalogService.ts` - Return Tier 2 only

##### Component Updates
- `ServerLibrary.tsx` - Fix filtering logic
- `DiscoveryPage.tsx` - Handle Tier 1‚Üí2 transitions
- `VisualWorkspace/index.tsx` - Handle Tier 2‚Üí3 transitions

## üìñ User Stories

### STORY-001: Configuration File Preview with Syntax Highlighting
**Status:** Backlog
**Priority:** Medium
**Task Reference:** Task 129

#### Story
As a user, I want to see the contents of my configuration file when I click on the filename in the status bar.

#### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Clicking filename opens inline preview
- [ ] JSON content has syntax highlighting
- [ ] Content is pretty-printed
- [ ] Preview can be dismissed (click outside/ESC)
- [ ] File is validated before display
- [ ] Invalid JSON shows error message

#### Technical Requirements
- Use existing Monaco Editor
- No custom syntax highlighting code
- Pretty-print with 2-space indentation
- Modal or popover display

---

### STORY-002: View Available Servers for Client
**Status:** In Progress
**Priority:** High
**Task Reference:** Task 51, Task 57b

#### Story
As a user, when I select a client, I want to see only servers that are installed but not yet configured for that client.

#### Current Problem
Server Library shows only configured servers instead of available ones.

#### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Client view shows installed but not configured servers
- [ ] Visual distinction between available and configured
- [ ] Dragging available server adds to configuration
- [ ] Deleting configured server returns to available

#### Example Scenario
- Given: 20 installed servers, Claude Desktop has 5 configured
- When: User selects Claude Desktop
- Then: Server Library shows 15 available servers

## ‚úÖ Tasks (Detailed Implementation)

### TASK-001: Implement Server Filtering Logic
**Status:** In Progress
**Priority:** High
**Links to:** STORY-002, REQ-002

#### Current State
```typescript
// WRONG: Shows configured servers instead of available
if (activeClient && activeClient !== 'catalog' && clientServers) {
  serversToShow = clientServers.map(...);
}
```

#### Required Implementation
```typescript
// CORRECT: Shows available servers (catalog - configured)
if (activeClient && activeClient !== 'catalog') {
  const configured = new Set(clientServers);
  serversToShow = catalog.filter(s =>
    s.installed && !configured.has(s.name)
  );
}
```

#### Files to Modify
- `/src/renderer/components/VisualWorkspace/ServerLibrary.tsx`
- `/src/renderer/store/simplifiedStore.ts`

#### Test Cases
1. Catalog view shows all installed servers
2. Client view shows only non-configured servers
3. All servers configured shows empty available list

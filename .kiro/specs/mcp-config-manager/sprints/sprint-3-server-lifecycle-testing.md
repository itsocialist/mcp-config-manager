### Integration Coverage
- [ ] Server install â†’ configure workflow: 90%
- [ ] Server monitoring â†’ UI updates: 85%
- [ ] Error handling â†’ user feedback: 80%

## Server Lifecycle Testing Focus

### Core Lifecycle Operations
1. **Discovery** â†’ Find available servers
2. **Installation** â†’ Install from npm/GitHub/Python
3. **Configuration** â†’ Add to client configs
4. **Monitoring** â†’ Health checks & metrics
5. **Testing** â†’ Validate functionality
6. **Management** â†’ Enable/disable/update
7. **Uninstallation** â†’ Clean removal

### Test Categories
- **Unit Tests**: Service logic and validation
- **Integration Tests**: IPC and workflow testing
- **Component Tests**: UI behavior and interactions
- **E2E Tests**: Complete user workflows

## Current Test Status

### Baseline Coverage (Post-P0)
- Overall coverage: ~45-50%
- Service coverage: ~60% (4 P0 services at 80%+)
- Component coverage: ~25%
- IPC Handler coverage: ~35%

### Test Execution Results
- **P0 Services**: 131 passing tests, 0 failures
- **Test Infrastructure**: Robust mocking and setup
- **Type Safety**: All tests fully typed
- **Performance**: Test execution < 15 seconds

## Risk Assessment

### Technical Risks
- **Medium**: Complex server installation testing
- **Low**: Integration test flakiness (mitigated with robust setup)
- **Low**: Component testing complexity (React Testing Library)

### Timeline Risks
- **Low**: P0 completion ahead of schedule
- **Medium**: Component testing may need prioritization

## Implementation Strategy

### Week 1 Focus (Current)
- **Monday-Tuesday**: P1 Service testing (InstallationService, McpDiscoveryService)
- **Wednesday-Thursday**: P1 Service testing (ConnectionMonitor, MetricsService)
- **Friday**: Coverage analysis and Week 2 planning

### Week 2 Focus (Planned)
- **Monday-Tuesday**: Component testing infrastructure
- **Wednesday-Thursday**: Visual Workspace component tests
- **Friday**: Integration tests and coverage validation

## Success Metrics

### Sprint 3 Week 1 Targets
- [x] Complete P0 service testing (131 tests)
- [ ] Complete P1 service testing (target: +100 tests)
- [ ] Establish component testing infrastructure
- [ ] Achieve 65% overall coverage

### Sprint 3 Week 2 Targets
- [ ] Complete component testing (target: 70% coverage)
- [ ] Implement integration tests
- [ ] Achieve 80% service + 70% component coverage
- [ ] Document test maintenance procedures

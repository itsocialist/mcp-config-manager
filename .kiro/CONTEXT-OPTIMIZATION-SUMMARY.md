# Context Optimization Implementation Summary

## âœ… Implemented Optimizations

### 1. **Separated Steering from Specs**
- **Steering Files** (`.kiro/steering/`): Always loaded for consistent behavior
  - `product.md` - Project purpose and focus
  - `structure.md` - File organization patterns
  - `tech.md` - Technology decisions
- **Specs Files** (`.kiro/specs/`): Loaded on-demand for specific tasks
  - Sprint plans, tasks, architecture docs

### 2. **Context-Specific Files Created**
- `.kiro/CONTEXT-VISUAL-WORKSPACE.md` - UI/frontend work
- `.kiro/CONTEXT-BACKEND-SERVICES.md` - Service refactoring
- `.kiro/CONTEXT-IPC.md` - IPC handler issues

### 3. **Self-Management Instructions Added**
- CLAUDE.md now instructs Claude Code to:
  - Auto-update sprint tasks at session start
  - Switch context based on work type
  - Suggest `/clear` when switching major areas
  - Monitor context health (message count, topic switches)

### 4. **Global CLAUDE.md Merged**
- Behavioral guidelines moved to project file
- Global file emptied (not deleted per user request)
- Saves ~40 tokens per message

### 5. **Sprint Task Updates**
- Updated to reflect Sprint 2 (60% complete)
- Shows 188 TypeScript errors remaining
- Highlights critical bugs (Task 119, 131)

## ðŸ“Š Token Savings Achieved

| Context Item | Before | After | Savings |
|-------------|--------|-------|---------|
| Base context | 2,765 | ~1,200 | 56% reduction |
| Global CLAUDE.md | 40 | 0 | 100% reduction |
| Task tracking | Variable | Targeted | ~70% reduction |
| **Total** | **2,805+** | **~1,200** | **~57% reduction** |

## ðŸŽ¯ Key Features

### Automatic Context Switching
```markdown
User: "I'm working on visual workspace"
Claude: [Loads CONTEXT-VISUAL-WORKSPACE.md automatically]
```

### Proactive Clear Notifications
```markdown
Claude: "âœ¨ Context switch detected: Moving from Visual Workspace to Backend Services.
You can use `/clear` to start fresh with the new context loaded."
```

### Smart Loading
- Steering files: ALWAYS loaded (consistent behavior)
- Specs: Loaded ON-DEMAND (saves tokens)
- Context files: SWITCHED based on work type

## ðŸ”„ Maintenance Required

### Weekly (5 minutes)
1. Update CLAUDE.md "Current Sprint Tasks" section
2. Remove completed bugs from "Active Bugs"
3. Check if sprint changed, update reference

### Per Sprint
1. Archive completed tasks (reduces token load)
2. Update sprint reference in CLAUDE.md
3. Create new sprint-specific context if needed

## ðŸ“ˆ Expected Benefits

1. **Reduced Tokens**: 57% immediate reduction, up to 70% with smart loading
2. **Better Focus**: Only relevant context loaded for current work
3. **Consistent Behavior**: Steering files always present
4. **Self-Maintaining**: Claude Code updates its own context
5. **Clear Notifications**: Proactive suggestions to refresh context

## Next Steps

- [ ] Archive completed tasks 1-22 to `.kiro/specs/archived/`
- [ ] Monitor context switching effectiveness
- [ ] Adjust thresholds based on usage patterns
